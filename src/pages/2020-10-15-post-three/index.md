So many people think that starting or “being good” on a weight loss journey involves giving up dining out. It’s simply NOT true!

Sure, you are able to control what’s in your food way more at home, but it doesn’t mean that going out (or ordering in these days) – even a couple times a week – is off the table

We have put together 10 principles you can easily follow that will continue to support your health and fitness goals - check them out:

1. Decide before you go – looking at the menu ahead of time and making a healthy choice can be a game changer. That way, you don’t even have to open the menu and   face unnecessary temptation.

2. Whatever protein you order, grill it, bake it, or broil it.

3. If you’re having an appetizer, choose a salad with vinegar-based dressing.

4. Order all sauces and dressings on the side.

5. Indulge in 1 thing instead of everything – either a glass of wine or a dessert or bread.

6. Ask for vegetables to come steamed, grilled or sautéed in water.

7. Drink a good amount of water before arriving at the restaurant and when you sit down.

8. Ask for “extras” like bread, chips, etc. not be brought to the table (if you know you can't resist it).

9. Don't feel guilty asking for substitutions.

10. Don’t feel pressure to eat all of your food – it’s ok to have leftovers!

BONUS ONE - Prosecco contains 80-90 calories choose this drink instead ;)

We hope that these guidelines help you enjoy that part of life while still staying on track with your health and fitness! And as always, if you know you need more support, guidance, and accountability, we've got you.

To your fitness and health,

Bo, Matt & Stevie
